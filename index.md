Welcome! This site contains information and activities to help you prepare for competing in [ASA DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/).

You are welcome to use any coding language you like at DataFest, but this site focuses on using R for DataFest. 

If you are new to R or Rtudio, you have two choices to gain access to the software. 
* Option 1: You can start [here](https://datafest-prep.github.io//software_installation/) download the software you need. This is free! 
* Option 2: You can start here to access RStudio Cloud online. 

If you are new to RMarkdown, start on the [RMarkdown](https://datafest-prep.github.io//class_activities/rmarkdown_instructions/) page. Note that using RMarkdown is optional, but it is a nice tool!

Once you have the all the softaware ready to go, the activities can be found in the [Course Calendar](https://datafest-prep.github.io//calendar/)
