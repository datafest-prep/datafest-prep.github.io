Welcome! This site contains information and activities to help you prepare for competing in [ASA DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/).

# What do I need to know before starting? 

You are welcome to use any coding language you like at DataFest, but this site focuses on using R. 

We have designed this site for students who have had a statistics course in regression, or are currently in a course on regression. However, you don't need more than that!

# Software 

If you are new to R or Rtudio, you have two choices to gain access to the software. Both are free!
* Option 1: You can [follow this link](https://datafest-prep.github.io//slides/RStudioCloud.html) to learn how to access RStudio online. 
* Option 2: You can [follow this link](https://datafest-prep.github.io//software_installation/) to learn how to download the software you need. 

If you are new to RMarkdown, start on the [RMarkdown](https://datafest-prep.github.io//class_activities/rmarkdown_instructions/) page. Note that using RMarkdown is optional, but it is a nice tool!

# Getting Started 

Once you have the all the software ready to go, head to the [Activities and Resources page](https://datafest-prep.github.io//calendar/) to get started!
