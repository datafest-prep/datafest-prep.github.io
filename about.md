# What is this site for?

This site provided activities to help us prepare for the American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest Competition. 

DataFest is a competition that takes place across the nation each spring for undergraduate and graduate students. Competitors will work in teams to analyze a large real world data set, and then present their results to a panel of judges. 

Past data sets have come from TicketMaster, Olympic sports teams, Edmunds, and so on. Last year's topic explored the abuse of sleep medications in college students. 

**Our competition will begin in April 2022.**

You will be competing in teams of 2-5 students.
