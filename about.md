# What is this course about?

In this course we will prepare for the American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest Competition. 

DataFest is a competition that takes place across the nation each spring for undergraduate and graduate students. Competitors will work in teams to analyze a large real world data set, and then present their results to a panel of judges. 

Past data sets have come from TicketMaster, Olympic sports teams, Edmunds, and so on. Last year's topic explored the abuse of sleep medications in college students. 

**Our competition will begin at 5:30 PM on Friday April 1st, and conclude around noon on Sunday April 3rd.**

# A Note about Perfume, Cologne, and Scented Products

Dr. Dalzell has a lung disability that reacts to perfume, cologne, scented lotion, body sprays, and any other scented products. In the presence of these products, Dr. Dalzell cannot breathe or speak.Because of this, students may not wear scented products in class or to any other face to face meeting with Dr. Dalzell. Please let Dr. Dalzell know if you have any questions!

# What if I am sick?

In any semester, but especially during this semester, it is important that any students who are feeling ill do not come to class. Rest will speed your recovery, and help us protect other students in the classroom. I offer Zoom office hours and appointments so students will be able to communicate with me even if they are not feeling well.

# Grading

Grading in this class is composed of 2 things - participation in class and participation in DataFest. The course will be graded on a pass/fail scale. 

To pass the course, you must fully paricipate in the course (which mean attending and participating in class activities) and fully participate in the DataFest competition (which means attending, working through the data task, and presenting with your team). 

**Note: Full participation in DataFest on April 1 - 3 is required to pass this course. If you are unable to attend, you need to drop the course.** If some emergency/illness comes up that means you cannot attend DataFest, you must contact Dr. Dalzell immediately. 

All participants in ASA DataFest agree to abide by the [ASA Code of Conduct](https://sites.google.com/wfu.edu/datafest2020/code-of-conduct)

# Anything I should know about sending emails?

I use a special system to help me answer your emails as fast as possible.When you email me, in the subject line of any email include STA 175 and brief description. Example: STA 175 Activity 1.

- I filter using this criteria to make sure I can answer your emails quickly!!
- If you do not put this in the header, I may miss your email, so make sure it is on there.

Monday through Friday, I will respond to email from 8 AM to 6 PM; messages received after 6 PM will be answered the following day. On Saturday and Sunday you may expect a response to emails by Sunday
evening.

# Accessibility and Inclusion

## Foundations for our course

In this course, we will treat one another with respect and celebrate each individual. Wake Forest is a community of individuals that seeks the enlightenment and freedom which come through diligent study
and learning. An even higher goal, however, is to give life to the University motto, Pro Humanitate, as the passion for knowledge is translated into compassionate service. Wake Forest fosters compassion and caring for others. Its collective strength and character are derived from the values and distinctive experiences of each individual; therefore, the richness of human intellect and culture is affirmed in its contribution to knowledge, faith, reason, and dialogue. Furthermore, Wake Forest strives toward a society in which good will, respect, and equality prevail. 

In this class, we will embrace diversity of age, background, beliefs,
ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, neurotype, race, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and other visible and non-visible categories. To that end, hatred, discrimination, and bigotry in any form will not be tolerated in this course. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.

## Names

Names and methods of address are importance. To ensure that I address you properly, I ask that all students tell me your preferred name at the beginning of the semester, and let me know at any time if your preferred name changes. We will address one another using these preferred names during our class to make sure we are respectful of everyone’s preferences. Using the Name Coach feature in Canvas is
particularly helpful to make sure we pronounce your preferred name correctly.

## Accessibility Policy

I want you all to have the tools and techniques to succeed in this class! If there is something you need or something that would be useful to support your success in this course, please reach out and let me know. I always like to know how to help my students feel comfortable and successful in our course.

Wake Forest University provides reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities through the Center for Learning, Access, and Student Success (118 Reynolda Hall, 336-758-5929, class.wfu.edu). If
you are in need of an accommodation, please contact CLASS as soon as possible.

As you all have already read, I have a lung disability the requires some accommodation from you (avoiding scents) so I know what it is like to go through the accommodation process and ask professors for help. It can seem intimidating, but please please please reach out if you have accommodations. I can’t help you if I don’t know what you need!
